# James Carter

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, a 12-week coding bootcamp, and am now looking for a challenging opportunity as a Junior Developer. I particularly enjoy coding in pairs and gain a lot of satisfaction from being completely lost in code on one day to having a comprehensive understanding of it the next. I am most familiar with Ruby and Javascript languages but am certainly open to learning others from scratch. My background before learning to code was in finance working at UBS and I also more recently spent time working in Chongqing, China.

#### UBS

##### Investment Assistant/ e-commerce

I held two roles over four years at UBS. Firstly I worked in private wealth management looking after client accounts and executing orders. Then after this I worked in Technology, specifically on the roll-out of a multi-asset trading platform named UBS Neo. The project used Agile practices and our team specifically oversaw the creation of an onboarding tool for clients. In my role I worked to oversee the development of this tool and also dealt with client queries on the platform.

## Interests

I am a very big fan of music and like spending my spare time listening to and discovering new music. I also enjoy cycling, swimming and travelling.
